# GalactixVSTi
GalactiX VSTi Synth from Smartelectronix

An open-source version of GalactiX VSTi plugin written at the time of my membership in great smartelectronix community as Alex @ smartelectronix in 2002. 
I want to thank bram @ smartelectronix  and entire SE team for encouraging talks, tests, advices and fun during the program development.  It was always my pity that such a great team was disaggregated into nothing and was not shaped into somethig good-working.
Later I had new versions of this synth (with anyi-aliased oscillators) but then I lost an access to smartelectronix web site.

The source code can be not so well organized and commented because:
1. it was written when I just started to learn and was not so experienced;
2. it was exciting and took only 2 months from start to the release of the final version of GalactiX! 


You can find the original GalactiX plugin on smartelectronix pages here: http://alex.smartelectronix.com
